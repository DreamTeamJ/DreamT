Aesop was one of the great Greek writers. He is best known for his fables, stories that have a moral. 
They teach us something about how we should live our lives. Aesop wrote thousands of these stories. 
Here are a few.
  The Wolf in Sheep's CLothing
Once upon a time, a Wolf decided to disguise the way he looked.
